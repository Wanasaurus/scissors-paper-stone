            <h1>Let's play scissors, paper, stone!</h1>
            <p>To kick off the game, pick one of three items: scissors, paper, or stone. The computer will choose a random item in response. Scissors beats paper, paper beats stone, you know how it goes.</p>
            <p>For each round, the winner gets one point, while the loser gets zero points. If it's a tie, neither party gets any point.</p>
            <p>The first party to attain five points will be the champion.</p>
